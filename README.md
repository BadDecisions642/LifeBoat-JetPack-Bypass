# Horion Configuration 
this is primarily desgined for ctw (capture the wool) but it has more practical uses too, i will also add this config is for Horion, i did NOT make horion this is just simply a config  for the client

Too import the config you must again know how to get paths from %localappdata%, if you dont i will briefly explain but i wont go in to depth, you must go the the path | C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\RoamingState\Horion | again "User" is where the name of your pc would go, once you are there move the config too that area i suppose, once done you can go in game and type .config load <whatever you renamed it too> unless you didnt rename it then in that case it would be .config load baddecisions
